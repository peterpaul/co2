Bug fixing:
* add automatic casting between arithmetic types, object types and void *. [DONE]
* promote float to double when passing through class constructor

Refactoring:
* add type member to declaration [DONE]

Code quality:
* retain/release all members properly [IN PROGRESS/DONE]
* run valgrind on testsuite
* generate error messages for incompatible types with the right line number

Functionality:
* add way to include c-code in syntax. (C-declaration) [IN PROGRESS/DONE]
* implement package keyword for bundling related classes
* implement file inclusion (include) [DONE]
* know whether a tokenexpression is part of the current class [DONE]
* implement casts [DONE]

Language Features:
* enum
* constructor/destructor [DONE]
* automatic reference counting
* super keyword [DONE]
* static keyword
* private keyword
* annotations
* add missing c types (like double)
* add structs [DONE]
* add typedefs [DONE]
* make one identifier type and use for types, identifiers and macros
* retrieve the class
* abstract classes [DONE]

* bash scripts for tests aren't really portable yet.
