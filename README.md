# co2
This repository contains the following Open Source projects

    libco2: object system library for C (LGPL)
    libco2-base: library with basic datatypes for libco2 (LGPL)
    carbon: compiler and programming language for libco2 (GPL)

# History
These projects started out as an experiment to investigate how to do Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in plain C. After some experiments and several redesigns I came up with a small library that evolved into what now is libco2.

I used libco2 for several experiments. These experiments include a lexical analyzer, a configuration file parser, a sudoku solver and a raytracer.

Then I realized that without the syntactic sugar of the libco2 library I could develop faster. So I started to create the carbon compiler and programming language. carbon is of course created with libco2.
